Need to try stuff out on glassfish. Currently only supporting platform according to oracle:
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaee/overview/compatibility-jsp-136984.html

Tomcat 8 will support JavaEE 7, alpha RC3 just released:
http://tomcat.apache.org/

Need to read more and see if Tomcat 8 is full Java EE 7 web profile or a subset

Looks like JBOSS AS8 will include the Java EE 7 features.
